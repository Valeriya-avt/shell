<br><img src="./images/shell.png" width="10%" alt = "image" align = "left"/> Welcome! Want to write your own shell, but don't know where to start? Use my open source shell and add your own ideas. Perhaps you can find simpler algorithms for what is already described in my program. I look forward to any of your comments!

### This shell can:
 * Standard launch of the program;
 * Redirect the input stream to a file;
 * Redirect input and output:
     - Redirect the output stream to a file;
     - Read from file;
     - Reading and writing to a file, writing and reading from a file in one run;
 * Run "&&" pipeline for multiple commands.
 * Run "|" pipeline for commands with redirection of input and output streams;
 * Change directory using `cd` command:
     - `cd` and `cd ~` to go to home directory;
     - `cd directory_name` to go to the specified directory (`cd ..` to go to the parent directory);
     - `cd -` to go to the previous directory;
 * Run programs in the background;
 * Ctrl + C.

### How to compile:

 - Download "sources" and Makefile;
 ```
 git clone ...
 ```
 - Press the key combination Ctrl + Alt + T;
 - Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where these files are stored. Pass the path to the required directory as a parameter;
 - Use the `make` command to compile.

### How to run:

 - `cd bin`
 - `./main` ... Yahoo! Shell is ready to go!

### How to use:
 First, let's look at the contents of the current directory. To do this, we will use the command `ls`.
<p align="center">

 Oops! Well... Now we know that the <del>most important</del> funniest command can work!
 We know where to find a locomotive. Let's travel through directories!
 Let's go to the parent directory using `—Åd` and using `pwd` to check that we really are in the parent directory:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/parent_dir%20and%20pwd.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Let's try using a combination of `cd` (or `cd ~`) and `cd -` to move between the current and home directories:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/home_dir%20and%20cd%20-%20.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Very well! We can move from one directory to another!
 Before choosing the next destination, let's look at the contents of the current directory using the `ls` command and go to any directory we find.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/ls%2C%20cd%20test.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Let's create some files, write to the file only what we are looking for, and display it on the screen using 

 ```ls > file.txt && grep -r .c < file.txt```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/ls%2C%20cd%20test.gif" width="80%"></p>

We can redirect input and output at the same time:
 ```
grep file < file.txt > file1.txt
 ```
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/read%2C%20write.gif" width="80%"></p>

 ```
grep file > file2.txt < file.txt
 ```
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/read%2C%20write%201.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Let's check how the `|` pipeline works:
 1. `ls -l | grep .txt`
 2. `ls | sort | grep c` and `ls | grep c | sort`

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/ls%2C%20sort%2C%20grep.gif" width="80%"></p>

 3. `sleep 5 | ls | sort`

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/sleep%2C%20ls%2C%20sort.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Let's start the pipeline from the previous example, but now we will not wait until the `sleep` is completed, we will use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + C**

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/sleep%2C%20Ctrl%20%2B%20C.gif" width="80%"></p>

Also in the pipeline, we can do input and output redirection:

```
cut -f 1 < file.txt | grep .txt | sort > file1.txt
```
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/pipe%20with%20input%2C%20output.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Now let's see how the "&&" pipeline works. Let's try to copy the code of any of the existing programs into a new file, compile and run the program by entering only one line:

```cp prog.c prog1.c && gcc prog1.c -o prog1 && ./prog1```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/cp%2C%20gcc%2C%20run.gif" width="80%"></p>

 Let's make sure that by starting the background process, we can work in our shell:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Valeriya-avt/shell/blob/master/images/background.gif" width="80%"></p>

The work of our shell can be terminated using `exit` or `quit`. The shell will not be terminated until all background processes have finished:

Thanks for seeing how this shell works! I hope you find it useful. I look forward to comments and new ideas!
